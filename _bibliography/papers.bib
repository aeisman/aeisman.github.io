              hypertension (exPH) among broader samples remains unclear.
              OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the association of
              exPH with clinical determinants and outcomes. METHODS: The
              authors studied individuals with chronic exertional dyspnea and
              preserved ejection fraction who underwent cardiopulmonary
              exercise testing with invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Exercise
              pulmonary hypertension was ascertained using minute-by-minute PAP
              and cardiac output (CO) measurements to calculate a PAP/CO slope,
              and exPH defined as a PAP/CO slope >3 mm Hg/l/min. The primary
              outcome was cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization or all-cause
              mortality. RESULTS: Among 714 individuals (age 57 years, 59\%
              women), 296 (41\%) had abnormal PAP/CO slopes. Over a mean
              follow-up of 3.7 $\pm$ 2.9 years, there were 208 CV or death
              events. Individuals with abnormal PAP/CO slope had a 2-fold
              increased hazard of future CV or death event
              (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio: 2.03; 95\% confidence
              interval: 1.48 to 2.78; p < 0.001). The association of abnormal
              PAP/CO slope with outcomes remained significant after excluding
              rest PH (n = 146, hazard ratio: 1.75; 95\% confidence interval:
              1.21 to 2.54; p = 0.003). Both pre- and post-capillary
              contributions to exPH independently predicted adverse events (p <
              0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise pulmonary hypertension is
              independently associated with CV event-free survival among
              individuals undergoing evaluation of chronic dyspnea. These
              findings suggest incremental value of exercise hemodynamic
              assessment to resting measurements alone in characterizing the
              burden of PH in individuals with dyspnea. Whether PH and PH

              (HFpEF) is common, yet there is currently no consensus on how to
              define HFpEF according to various society and clinical trial
              criteria. How clinical and hemodynamic profiles of patients vary
              across definitions is unclear. We sought to determine clinical
              characteristics, as well as physiologic and prognostic
              implications of applying various criteria to define HFpEF.
              METHODS: We examined consecutive patients with chronic exertional
              dyspnea (New York Heart Association class II to IV) and ejection
              fraction $\geq$50\% referred for comprehensive cardiopulmonary
              exercise testing with invasive hemodynamic monitoring. We applied
              societal and clinical trial HFpEF definitions and compared
              clinical profiles, exercise responses, and cardiovascular
              outcomes. RESULTS: Of 461 patients (age 58$\pm$15 years, 62\%
              women), 416 met American College of Cardiology/American Heart
              Association (ACC/AHA), 205 met European Society of Cardiology
              (ESC), and 55 met Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA)
              criteria for HFpEF. Clinical profiles and exercise capacity
              varied across definitions, with peak oxygen uptake of
              16.2$\pm$5.2 (ACC/AHA), 14.1$\pm$4.2 (ESC), and 12.7$\pm$3.1
              mL·kg-1·min-1 (HFSA). A total of 243 patients had hemodynamic
              evidence of HFpEF (abnormal rest or exercise filling pressures),
              of whom 222 met ACC/AHA, 161 met ESC, and 41 met HFSA criteria.
              Over a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, the incidence of
              cardiovascular outcomes ranged from 75 (ACC/AHA) to 298 events
              per 1000 person-years (HFSA). Application of clinical trial
              definitions of HFpEF similarly resulted in distinct patient
              classification and prognostication. CONCLUSIONS: Use of different
              HFpEF classifications variably enriches for future cardiovascular
              events, but at the expense of not including up to 85\% of
              individuals with physiologic evidence of HFpEF. Comprehensive

              the limitations and heterogeneity of current HFpEF definitions

              interventions.",

              ventricle (RV) exercise reserve and its relationship to outcomes

              CPET (n=147) with first-pass radionuclide ventriculography at a
              single tertiary care centre. RV reserve was categorised as
              normal, mild to moderately or severely impaired. The primary
              composite clinical outcome included clinical right HF,
              arrhythmia, transplantation or death. RESULTS: Patients were

              was 1.1 (IQR: 0.7-2.0) years. Exercise RV reserve was impaired in
              103 patients (70\%), of whom 32\% were asymptomatic. Resting RV
              systolic function poorly predicted RV reserve, with 52\% of
              patients with severe impairment having a qualitatively normal
              echocardiographic assessment. The severely impaired reserve group
              had lower peak oxygen consumption (VO2)(17.2 vs 22.5 mL/kg/min,
              p<0.0001) compared with the normal reserve group, and was more
              likely to develop the composite outcome (48\% vs 9\%, log-rank

              predicted by resting systolic function assessment, and strongly

              pressure at rest lack sensitivity for identifying heart failure
              with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in patients with dyspnea
              on exertion. We hypothesized that exercise hemodynamic
              measurements (ie, changes in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
              [PCWP] indexed to cardiac output [CO]) may more sensitively
              differentiate HFpEF and non-HFpEF disease states, reflect aerobic
              capacity, and forecast heart failure outcomes in individuals with
              normal PCWP at rest. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 175 patients
              referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing with hemodynamic
              monitoring: controls (n=33), HFpEF with resting PCWP$\geq$15 mm
              Hg (n=32), and patients with dyspnea on exertion with normal
              resting PCWP and left ventricular ejection fraction (DOE-nlrW;
              n=110). Across 1835 paired PCWP-CO measurements throughout
              exercise, we used regression techniques to define normative
              bounds of ``PCWP/CO slope'' in controls and tested the
              association of PCWP/CO slope with exercise capacity and composite
              cardiac outcomes (defined as cardiac death, incident resting PCWP
              elevation, or heart failure hospitalization) in the DOE-nlrW
              group. Relative to controls (PCWP/CO slope, 1.2$\pm$0.4 mm
              Hg/L/min), patients with HFpEF had a PCWP/CO slope of 3.4$\pm$1.9
              mm Hg/L/min. We used a threshold (2 SD above the mean in
              controls) of 2 mm Hg/L/min to define abnormal. PCWP/CO slope >2
              in DOE-nlrW patients was common (n=45/110) and was associated
              with reduced peak Vo2 (P2 mm Hg/L/min) is common in DOE-nlrW and
              predicts exercise capacity and heart failure outcomes. These
              findings suggest that current definitions of HFpEF based on
              single measures during rest are insufficient and that assessment
              of exercise PCWP/CO slope may refine early HFpEF diagnosis.",

  abstract = "Background -Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
              (HFpEF) is a common syndrome with a pressing shortage of
              therapies. Exercise intolerance is a cardinal symptom of HFpEF,
              yet its pathophysiology remains uncertain. Methods -We
              investigated the mechanism of exercise intolerance in each of 134
              patients referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET): 79
              with HFpEF and 55 controls. We performed CPET with invasive
              monitoring to measure hemodynamics, blood gases, and gas exchange
              during exercise. We used these measurements to quantify 6 steps
              of oxygen transport and utilization (the ``O2 pathway'') in each
              HFpEF patient, identifying the defective steps that impair each
              one's exercise capacity (peak VO2). We then quantified the
              functional significance of each O2 pathway defect by calculating
              the improvement in exercise capacity a patient could expect from
              correcting the defect. Results -Peak VO2)was reduced by
              34\%$\pm$2\% (mean$\pm$SEM, P<0.001) in HFpEF compared with
              controls of comparable age, gender, and body mass index. The vast
              majority (97\%) of HFpEF patients harbored defects at multiple
              steps of the O2 pathway, the identity and magnitude of which
              varied widely. Two of these steps, cardiac output and skeletal
              muscle O2 diffusion, were impaired relative to controls by an
              average of 27$\pm$3\% and 36$\pm$2\%, respectively (P<0.001 for
              both). Due to interactions between a given patient's defects, the
              predicted benefit of correcting any single one was often minor;
              on average, correcting a patient's cardiac output led to a
              7$\pm$0.5\% predicted improvement in exercise intolerance, while
              correcting a patient's muscle diffusion capacity led to a
              27$\pm$1\% improvement. At the individual level, the impact of
              any given O2 pathway defect on a patient's exercise capacity was
              strongly influenced by comorbid defects. Conclusions -Systematic
              analysis of the O2 pathway in HFpEF showed that exercise capacity
              was undermined by multiple defects, including reductions in
              cardiac output and skeletal muscle diffusion capacity. An
              important source of disease heterogeneity stemmed from variation
              in each patient's personal profile of defects. Personalized O2
              pathway analysis could identify patients most likely to benefit
              from treating a specific defect; however, the system properties
              of O2 transport favor treating multiple defects at once, as with
              exercise training.",

              rowing recently mandated the inclusion of 12-lead ECG during
              preparticipation screening. We therefore sought to describe
              normative ECG characteristics and to examine the prevalence of
              abnormal ECG findings as defined by contemporary athlete ECG
              interpretation criteria among competitive rowers. METHODS:
              Competitive rowers (n=330, 56\% male) underwent standard 12-lead
              ECG at the time of collegiate preparticipation screening. ECGs
              were analysed quantitatively to develop a sport-specific
              normative database and then for the presence of abnormalities in
              accordance with the 2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
              recommendations and 2013 'Seattle Criteria.' RESULTS: 94\% of
              rowers had one or more training-related ECG patterns including
              sinus bradycardia (51\%), sinus arrhythmia (55\%), and incomplete
              right bundle branch block (42\%). Males were more likely than
              females to have isolated voltage criteria for left ventricular
              hypertrophy (LVH) (51\% vs 8\%, p<0.001) and early repolarisation
              pattern (76\% vs 23\%, p<0.001). Application of the 2010 ESC
              criteria, compared to the Seattle criteria, resulted in the
              classification of a significantly greater number of abnormal ECGs
              (47\% vs 4\%; p<0.001). The detection of true pathology,
              accomplished by both interpretation criteria, was confined to a
              single case of ventricular pre-excitation. CONCLUSIONS:
              Training-related ECG patterns with several gender-based
              differences are common among competitive rowers. The diagnostic
              accuracy and down-stream clinical implications of ECG-inclusive
              preparticipation screening among rowers will be dictated by the

              adulthood on long-term cardiovascular structure, function, and
              prognosis is less clear. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether CRF in
              young adults is associated with long-term clinical outcome and
              subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND
              PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 4872 US adults aged 18 to 30
              years who underwent treadmill exercise testing at a baseline
              study visit from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986, and 2472
              individuals who underwent a second treadmill test 7 years later.
              Median follow-up was 26.9 years, with assessment of obesity, left
              ventricular mass and strain, coronary artery calcification (CAC),
              and vital status and incident CVD. Follow-up was complete on
              August 31, 2011, and data were analyzed from recruitment through
              the end of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The presence of
              CAC was assessed by computed tomography at years 15 (2000-2001),
              20 (2005-2006), and 25 (2010-2011), and left ventricular mass was
              assessed at years 5 (1990-1991) and 25 (with global longitudinal
              strain). Incident CVD and all-cause mortality were adjudicated.
              RESULTS: Of the 4872 individuals, 273 (5.6\%) died and 193
              (4.0\%) experienced CVD events during follow-up. After
              comprehensive adjustment, each additional minute of baseline
              exercise test duration was associated with a 15\% lower hazard of
              death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.91; P < .001) and
              a 12\% lower hazard of CVD (HR, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.81-0.96; P =
              .002). Higher levels of baseline CRF were associated with
              significantly lower left ventricular mass index (beta = -0.24;
              95\% CI, -0.45 to -0.03; P = .02) and significantly better lobal
              longitudinal strain (beta = -0.09; 95\% CI, -0.14 to -0.05; P <
              .001) at year 25. Fitness was not associated with CAC. A 1-minute
              reduction in fitness by year 7 was associated with 21\% and 20\%
              increased hazards of death (HR, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.37; P =
              .002) and CVD (HR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.37; P = .006),
              respectively, along with a more impaired strain (beta = 0.15;
              95\% CI, 0.08-0.23; P < .001). No association between change in
              fitness and CAC was found. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher
              levels of fitness at baseline and improvement in fitness early in
              adulthood are favorably associated with lower risks for CVD and
              mortality. Fitness and changes in fitness are associated with
              myocardial hypertrophy and dysfunction but not CAC. Regular
              efforts to ascertain and improve CRF in young adulthood may play
              a critical role in promoting cardiovascular health and
              interrupting early CVD pathogenesis.",

              determine the association of native T1 with myocardial structure
              and function, we prospectively studied 39 patients with NIC
              (defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) </= 50\%
              without cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) evidence of previous
              infarction) and 27 subjects with normal LVEF without known overt

              attenuation on computed tomography (CT), has emerged as a
              potential biomarker of ``fat quality.'' We sought to characterize
              the relationship between fat radiodensity and quantity in
              subcutaneous, visceral, and intermuscular fat depots, and its
              role in inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome
              (MetS). METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 1511 individuals from the
              Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who underwent CT for
              measurement of regional fat distribution and radiodensity, along
              with biomarker assessments and adjudication of incident metabolic
              syndrome (MetS). Linear, logistic and Cox regression analyses
              were used to measure association between fat radiodensity and (1)
              fat quantity, (2) biomarkers of cardiometabolic dysfunction, and
              (3) both prevalent and incident MetS. In each fat depot,
              radiodensity was strongly and inversely associated with quantity
              (e.g., visceral fat radiodensity vs. quantity: rho = -0.82, P <
              0.01). After adjustment for age, sex and race, lower visceral fat
              radiodensity was associated with greater C-reactive protein,
              leptin and insulin, but lower adiponectin (P < 0.01 for all).
              After full adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors,
              visceral (but not subcutaneous or intermuscular) fat radiodensity
              was associated with prevalent MetS (OR = 0.96, 95\% CI =
              0.93-0.99, P = 0.01). Moreover, lower visceral fat radiodensity
              was associated with incident MetS after the same adjustment (HR =
              0.95, 95\% CI 0.93-0.98, P < 0.01). However, this association
              became non-significant after further adjustment for visceral fat
              quantity. CONCLUSION: Fat radiodensity is strongly correlated
              with fat quantity and relevant inflammatory biomarkers. Fat
              radiodensity (especially for visceral fat) may be a
              complementary, easily assessed marker of cardiometabolic risk.",

              morphogenesis. Rho activation in developing neurons slows
              dendrite branch dynamics, yielding smaller, less branched
              dendrite arbors. Constitutive activation of Rho in mature neurons
              causes dendritic spine loss and dendritic regression, indicating
              that Rho can affect dendritic structure and function even after
              dendrites have developed. However, it is unclear whether and how
              endogenous Rho modulates dendrite and synapse morphology after
              dendrite arbor development has occurred. We demonstrate that a
              Rho inhibitory pathway involving the Arg tyrosine kinase and
              p190RhoGAP is essential for synapse and dendrite stability during
              late postnatal development. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal dendrites
              develop normally in arg-/- mice, reaching their mature size by
              postnatal day 21 (P21). However, dendritic spines do not undergo
              the normal morphological maturation in these mice, leading to a
              loss of hippocampal synapses and dendritic branches by P42.
              Coincident with this synapse and dendrite loss, arg-/- mice
              exhibit progressive deficits in a hippocampus-dependent object
              recognition behavioral task. p190RhoGAP localizes to dendritic
              spines, and its activity is reduced in arg-/- hippocampus,
              leading to increased Rho activity. Although mutations in
              p190rhogap enhance dendritic regression resulting from decreased
              Arg levels, reducing gene dosage of the Rho effector ROCKII can
              suppress the dendritic regression observed in arg-/- mice.
              Together, these data indicate that signaling through Arg and
              p190RhoGAP acts late during synaptic refinement to promote
              dendritic spine maturation and synapse/dendrite stability by
              attenuating synaptic Rho activity.",

              the percent increase in pulmonary vessel diameter per mm Hg
              increase in pressure, permits the pulmonary vessels to increase
              in size to accommodate increased blood flow. We hypothesized that
              PV distensibility is abnormally low in patients with heart
              failure (HF) and serves as an important determinant of right
              ventricular performance and exercise capacity. METHODS AND
              RESULTS: Patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction
              (n=48), HF with reduced ejection fraction (n=55), pulmonary
              arterial hypertension without left heart failure (n=18), and
              control subjects (n=30) underwent cardiopulmonary exercise
              testing with invasive hemodynamic monitoring and first-pass
              radionuclide ventriculography. PV distensibility was derived from
              1257 matched measurements (mean+/-SD, 8.3+/-2.8 per subject) of
              pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure
              and cardiac output. PV distensibility was lowest in the pulmonary
              arterial hypertension group (0.40+/-0.24\% per mm Hg) and
              intermediate in the HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF
              with reduced ejection fraction groups (0.92+/-0.39 and
              0.84+/-0.33\% per mm Hg, respectively) compared to the control
              group (1.39+/-0.32\% per mm Hg, P<0.0001 for all three). PV
              distensibility was associated with change in right ventricular
              ejection fraction (RVEF, rho=0.39, P<0.0001) with exercise and
              was an independent predictor of peak VO2. PV distensibility also
              predicted cardiovascular mortality independent of peak VO2 in HF
              patients (n=103; Cox hazard ratio, 0.30; 95\% confidence
              interval, 0.10-0.93; P=0.036). In a subset of patients with HF
              with reduced ejection fraction (n=26), 12 weeks of treatment with
              the pulmonary vasodilator sildenafil or placebo led to a 24.6\%
              increase in PV distensibility (P=0.015) in the sildenafil group
              only. CONCLUSIONS: PV distensibility is reduced in patients with
              HF and pulmonary arterial hypertension and is closely related to
              RV systolic function during exercise, maximal exercise capacity,
              and survival. Furthermore, PV distensibility is modifiable with
              selective pulmonary vasodilator therapy and may represent an
              important target for therapy in selected HF patients with
              pulmonary hypertension. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

              (Vo2) is similarly impaired in patients with heart failure with
              preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with
              reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, characterization of
              how each component of Vo2 changes in response to incremental
              exercise in HFpEF versus HFrEF has not been previously defined.
              We hypothesized that abnormally low peripheral o2 extraction
              (arterio-mixed venous o2 content difference, [C(a-v)o2]) during
              exercise significantly contributes to impaired exercise capacity
              in HFpEF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed maximum incremental
              cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive hemodynamic
              monitoring on 104 patients with symptomatic NYHA II to IV heart
              failure (HFpEF, n=48, peak Vo2=13.9+/-0.5 mL kg(-1) min(-1),
              mean+/-SEM, and HFrEF, n=56, peak Vo2=12.1+/-0.5 mL kg(-1)
              min(-1)) and 24 control subjects (peak Vo2 27.0+/-1.7 mL kg(-1)
              min(-1)). Peak exercise C(a-v)o2 was lower in HFpEF compared with
              HFrEF (11.5+/-0.27 versus 13.5+/-0.34 mL/dL, respectively,
              P<0.0001), despite no differences in age, hemoglobin level, peak
              respiratory exchange ratio, Cao2, or cardiac filling pressures.
              Peak C(a-v)o2 and peak heart rate emerged as the leading
              predictors of peak Vo2 in HFpEF. Impaired peripheral o2
              extraction was the predominant limiting factor to exercise
              capacity in 40\% of patients with HFpEF and was closely related
              to elevated systemic blood pressure during exercise (r=0.49,
              P=0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: In the first study to directly measure
              C(a-v)o2 throughout exercise in HFpEF, HFrEF, and normals, we
              found that peak C(a-v)o2 was a major determinant of exercise
              capacity in HFpEF. The important functional limitation imposed by
              impaired o2 extraction may reflect intrinsic abnormalities in
              skeletal muscle or peripheral microvascular function, and
